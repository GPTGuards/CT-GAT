# TCAB Dataset
1. Download the `TCAB` dataset
You can go to [https://github.com/REACT-NLP/tcab_generation](https://github.com/REACT-NLP/tcab_generation#dataset-and-target-models) to get the dataset for training CT-GAT (you will get two files: `train.csv` and `val.csv`).
2. Run `preprocess.py` to get all successful attack data, which will be used as the training set and validation set.
